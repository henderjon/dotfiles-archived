Worse is better

... simplicity of both the interface and the implementation are more important than any other attributes of the systemâ€”including correctness, consistency, and completeness. There is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

Unix Philosophy:

  - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
  - Write programs to work together.
  - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

  - Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
  - A little copying is better than a little dependency.
  - Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
  - Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
  - Cgo is not Go.
