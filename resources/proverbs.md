Worse is better

  - ... simplicity of both the interface and the implementation are more important than any other attributes of the systemâ€”including correctness, consistency, and completeness. There is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

This is the Unix philosophy:

  - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
  - Write programs to work together.
  - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

This is the Python philosophy

  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  - Explicit is better than implicit.
  - Simple is better than complex.
  - Complex is better than complicated.
  - Flat is better than nested.
  - Sparse is better than dense.
  - Readability counts.
  - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules, although practicality beats purity.
  - Errors should never pass silently, unless explicitly silenced.
  - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  - Now is better than never, although never is often better than *right* now.
  - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Pike Proverbs

  - Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
  - Concurrency is not parallelism.
  - Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
  - The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
  - Make the zero value useful.
  - `interface{}` says nothing.
  - Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
  - A little copying is better than a little dependency.
  - Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
  - Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
  - Cgo is not Go.
  - With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
  - Clear is better than clever.
  - Reflection is never clear.
  - Errors are values.
  - Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
  - Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
  - Documentation is for users.
  - Don't panic.
