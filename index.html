			<p>I don't have much to say.</p>

			<h2>about</h2>

			<p>Jon Henderson is a self-trained developer whose hobby turned into
			something more. Currently the Software Engineering Manager at myON, he
			oversees the dev team, the code base, and the day to day ins-and-outs of
			the dev process for an education based SAAS reading platform that serves
			an ever growing number of books to hundreds of thousands of students
			around the world every day. He enjoys learning, but enjoys his family
			more. He currently lives in Roseville with his wife Jessie, twin sons
			Walker and Davis, and his dog Goose where he spends most of his free time
			cooking, reading, going on walks, and training to be a curmudgeon.

			<ul>
				<li>Simplicity is both a goal and a method</li>
				<li>Solve one problem at a time</li>
				<li>A solution without a problem is a problem</li>
				<li>Clear is better than clever</li>
				<li>Clarity is worth the fight</li>
				<li>Readable means Reliable</li>
				<li>The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction</li>
				<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea</li>
				<li>Make it run, then make it right, then make it fast</li>
				<li>Patterns are not rules</li>
				<li>Code vertically</li>
				<li>Code for the problem; A tool that does everything does nothing well</li>
